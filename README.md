# E-Commerce-Project
A primary E-Commerce webpage made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase a few projects using a fake API.
The file index.html contains the HTML code for the project.
The folder CSS contains two files style.css and mediaquery.css incorporating the CSS stylings for the page 
and additional properties to make the page more responsive.
The folder JS contains the JavaScript code for the basic logic building of the page.
The delete button in each gives the users the advantage of deleting a product from the page.
The focus of the project is to learn basic styling and logic-building.
